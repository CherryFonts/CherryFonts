- 👋 Hi, I’m Todd Johnson, a founder of @CherryFonts, which is a hobby type design foundry.
- 👀 I’m primarily interested in very early printed type and various quill hands up to that period.
- 🌱 I’m not a font engineer. I work full time in IT, but more in VM management and SysEng, not software dev. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: I may release a nice old style font (and others) to Google, if I can get some font engineering assistance.
- 📫 How to reach me: cherryfonts@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Whatever you like.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm almost retired. I've been designing vector-based type since the late 80s but took a very long haiatus to earn a living.
